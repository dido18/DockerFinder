**Enhanced discovery of Docker
images**  is the title of the thesis submitted for the degree of

## What is Docker Finder ?
Docker Finder is a tool enabling a more powerful search of Docker images with
respect to the tools currently provided by the Docker platform (**docker search**, **Docker Hub**).


## Docker Finder steps
The main steps performed by Docker Finder are the following:

1. *Download* Docker images from a Docker registry (e.g. Docker Hub),
2. *generate* a descriptions of the images into a local storage,
and
3. users can search the images via APIs and a GUI.

### How to run Docker Finder
**Docker Finder**  architecture can be runned with *Docker-compose* or using the swarm mode of *Docker 1.12*.

#### Docker-compose mode

In order to run all the microservices of the architecture, you should launch the following commmand from within the main folder of the project.
```
$ docker-compose up
```

### Docker 1.12 swarm mode

The initializarion script `init-all.sh` does:

- initialize am overlay network (if it does not exist).
- *Build* and *push* the images into Docker HUb.

The `start_all.sh` script:
- *create* the services by downloading the images from Docker Hub.
- *run* the services:
    - **Crawler**, **RabbiMQ**, **images_server**, **images_db**,**software_server**,**software_db**  ,**monitor**: run in the same host with a constraint  label.
    - **scanner** can run in a ny host that are partecipating in the swarm.
